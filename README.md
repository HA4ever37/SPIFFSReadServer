# SPIFFSReadServer
This is an update to the SPI Flash File System to support LittleFS (instead of legacy SPIFFS) server extension of the ESP8266WebServer library. This is intended to handle 'read-only' static files without the need for a live editor. Of course files can still be modified programmatically or via other server handlers
